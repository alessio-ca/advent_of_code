# Advent of Code 2020 Challenges (in Python)

This repository contains the solutions to the Advent of Code challenges in Python. Most of the solutions make heavy use of the very powerful `numpy` library (https://numpy.org) for fast calculations, but I have also implemented pure Python solutions (especially for set-based challenges). Other libraries for scientific computation (such as SciPy or NetworkX) are also used. 

## Set up the environment
You can quickly setup the environment via Poetry (https://python-poetry.org).
Simply execute `poetry install` in the root directory and you are good to go!

## How to run the programs?

Execute the functions as a Python package from the root directory, for example:
```
python -m 2020.01.main
```
