# Advent of Code Challenges (in Python)

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code (https://adventofcode.com/2020) challenges in Python. Solutions typically use the very powerful `numpy` library (https://numpy.org) for fast calculations, or pure Python solutions. Other libraries for scientific computation (such as SciPy, Numba or NetworkX) are also occasionally used. 

For the time being, I am working on the 2020 solutions. Once they are finished, I will crawl down the past years as well :)

## Set up the environment
You can quickly setup the environment via Poetry (https://python-poetry.org).
Simply execute `poetry install` in the root directory and you are good to go!

## How to run the programs?

Execute the functions as a Python package from the root directory, for example:
```
python -m 2020.01.main
```
