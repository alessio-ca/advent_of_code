# Advent of Code Challenges (in Python)

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code (https://adventofcode.com/2020) challenges in Python. A blend of pure Python and `numpy` (https://numpy.org) is typically employed. Other libraries for scientific computation (such as SciPy, Numba or NetworkX) are also occasionally used. 

For the time being, I completed the 2020 edition & partially completed the 2019 edition. Currently working on the 2021 edition. Once it is finished, I will crawl down the past years as well :)

## Set up the environment
You can quickly setup the environment via Poetry (https://python-poetry.org).
Simply execute `poetry install` in the root directory and you are good to go!

Execute `poetry shell` to activate the environment in a shell terminal.


## How to run the programs?

Execute the functions as a Python package from the root directory, for example:
```
python -m 2021.01.main
```
